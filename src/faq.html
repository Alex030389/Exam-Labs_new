                            If you do not see emails from us, that's most likely because they have landed to your Spam/Junk folder. Please check these folders, and once you find an email from <a class="link link--invert" href="#">support@exam-labs.com</a>, open it and remove the Spam label. To prevent Exam-labs.com messages from being marked as Spam in the future, add <a class="link link--invert" href="#">support@exam-labs.com</a> to your email address book, so it is recognized as a trusted email.

                            If you need to retrieve your registration confirmation email and link to finalize your registration, please use the <a class="link link--invert" href="#">Forgot Password page</a>, and we'll re-send the message to you. Before you proceed, however, make sure you have completed the previous steps so this email doesn't end up in your spam folder again.
