Thus, the User bears responsibility for running such prohibited ways of use of all the Company's Products.</p>
            <p>Continuous efforts are undertaken by the Company all the time while offering the improvise the products and services to the User to provide him/her with the maximum benefit.

            <h5>Unlimited Subscription</h5>
            <p>Unlimited Subscription Products (further mentioned as the "Unlimited Subscription Products") means the access to all the Products at the Website offered separately during the Subscription Period. The Subscription Period (further mentioned as the "Subscription Period") starts on the date when the User has purchases the Unlimited Subscription Products.</p>
            <p>At the end of the subscription period, the User's rights to use Unlimited Subscription Products expires and he/she has no longer access to Unlimited Subscription Products.</p>
            <p>The Company reserves the right to stop or suspend Subscription Period of the User in case of violation of any Terms of Use by him/her if we have proof of that fact. The same can be implemented in case the User's right to utilize the Unlimited Subscription Products causes any disturbance to other's right or incurs the Company to bear any legal liabilities.</p>
            <h5>Placing an Order</h5>
            <p>While ordering a product, the User will come across multiple options. It is advisable to read them properly to have the complete information before making the choice. In case of any doubt, <a href="mailto:support@exam-labs.com">contact us</a> beforehand so that we can assist the User about the product(s) or/and service(s) concerned and help him/her make the right choice and place the order.</p>
            <p>We do everything possible to respond to the User's request promptly, however we cannot guarantee that it will always be so. Therefore, the User bears responsibility for collecting additional information on product(s) or/and service(s) from us before choosing to get it.</p>
            <p>The Company can cancel or reject any order at any time without indicating any specific reason. As per these Terms of Use and the acceptance of the order by us, the orders placed by the User at the Website will be considered as an offer from his/her end to buy the product(s) or/and service(s) which we deliver.</p>
            <h5>Pricing</h5>
            <p>All prices include VAT, unless otherwise indicated. Prices for any services or products that the User may want to purchase are clearly indicated in the section that he/she chooses at the Website. We are not responsible for removing or refusal or any failure that occurs while processing the order of purchasing the products or services available at the Website.</p>
            <p>Before confirming the order, the total price will be shown to the User.</p>
            <p>The right to update/withdraw/amend the price of any product or service at any time is reserved by us. We do not need to give any prior notice to it. All prices given at the Website are mostly correct, but there are possibilities of error. In case any error occurs then all transactions regarding to it will be voided by us and full refund will be made.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to update, withdraw or modify any services and products that we offer, or to change their prices at any time without prior explanation or notification. Though we put in more of an effort to make prices always actual and correct, in case of any mistake, any transaction of such kind will be canceled by us, and the User will be entitled to a full refund.</p>
            <h5>Payment method</h5>
            <p>Whenever the User makes any payment online via credit or debit card, the card details are directly sent to the service provider (acquiring bank) to initiate the transaction. The Company makes sure that no such card information is being unauthentically accessed by any third party. This eliminates the possibility that such data becomes available to third parties when transmitted electronically.</p>
            <p>Still, there's no 100% guarantee of data security that's why the User should try his/her best to protect the data from unauthorized access by third parties while making the transaction.</p>
            <h5>Recurring Payments (Subscription)</h5>
            <p>In case the User does not go for one-time payment but purchases the Unlimited Subscription Products, then he/she automatically agrees on creating the subscription. The day the User is registered for the Unlimited Subscription Products, is the day he/she pays for the subscription. Depending on the chosen plan, the User can pay for 1 month, 1 year or any other subscription period. Based on the service plan, automatic payments recur in a subscription plan.</p>
            <p>The User can cancel the recurring charges at any time by following the cancellation link which he/she can find at the corresponding page in his/her personal profile at the Website. In this case the User's account will remain active only during the time frame which remains according to the chosen payment cycle.</p>
            <h5>Product Delivery and Terms of Delivery</h5>
            <p>On purchasing the Product, the User will receive an email to the email address associated with his/her Website personal account. It contains a step by step guide on the process of downloading and using the purchased product(s) and service(s). Normally, the access to the Product is given right after the purchase. As the User's order is placed and payment is made, access to a relevant page of the Website along with a link to the Product purchased will be provided, or in some cases an activation code might be given as well. In case both aren't received by the User, then the Company will offer the User another way to get the Product available. In cases where the credit card requires manual verification, there is a possibility of delay in delivery of the Product up to 12 hours max.</p>
            <p>If you User has opted for the Unlimited Subscription Products, so in accordance with the selected subscription type, each Unlimited Subscription Products subscription will be kept active for a certain period of time – the Subscription Period. The User can cancel his/her subscription at any time. However, the User does not cancel the subscription, then the subscription will remain automatically-recurring, i.e. User's credit card will be billed each Subscription Period automatically. On the other hand, one-time purchases remain active for the period depending on the Product service time.</p>
            <p>In case of any questions and quires regarding the purchased Product or any other issue related to the Service provided at the Website, please, <a href="mailto:support@exam-labs.com">contact us</a>.</p>
